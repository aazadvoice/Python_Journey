## Overview

**Python Journey** documents a structured, self-driven path through key elements of data science using Jupyter Notebooks—spanning languages, tools, and domains including Python, R, SQL, MongoDB, and machine learning.

## Topics Covered

| Topic             | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Python**       | Core syntax, data manipulation (pandas, NumPy), and foundational scripting. |
| **Machine Learning** | Supervised & unsupervised techniques, model development, evaluation, and visualization. |
| **SQL**          | Relational database querying, table joins, aggregations, and data extraction. |
