    "How to decide the Data structures for the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Deciding on the right data structure for a problem is a crucial step in designing an efficient algorithm. The choice of data structure can significantly impact the performance and scalability of your solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the Problem\n",
    "Before choosing a data structure, it's essential to thoroughly understand the problem requirements and constraints. Consider the following aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "Access Patterns:\n",
    "Identify how data will be accessed and manipulated. Does the problem involve frequent insertions, deletions, or lookups?\n",
    "\n",
    "Space Complexity:\n",
    "Understand the memory constraints of the problem. Some data structures may consume more memory than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time Complexity:\n",
    "Evaluate the time complexity of various operations. Certain data structures excel in specific operations but might be inefficient in others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordered vs. Unordered Data:\n",
    "Determine whether the order of the data matters or if it can be arbitrary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Data Structures\n",
    "Let's delve into common data structures and scenarios where they are well-suited.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Arrays\n",
    "Use Case: When the data is ordered, and random access or sequential access is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Searching for an element by index, iterating through a collection of items.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Linked Lists\n",
    "Use Case: Ideal for frequent insertions and deletions, where the order matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Implementing a queue or a stack, maintaining a sorted list.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Stacks\n",
    "Use Case: LIFO (Last In, First Out) behavior, such as function call tracking or parsing expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Balancing parentheses in an expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Queues\n",
    "Use Case: FIFO (First In, First Out) behavior, suitable for tasks like managing task scheduling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Breadth-first search in a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Dictionary\n",
    "Use Case: Fast lookups and key-value pair storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Implementing a dictionary or a symbol table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world Examples -\n",
    "Let's consider a practical problem and analyze the data structure selection process.\n",

    "\n",
    "Calculate Total Cost Quickly: Use a data structure that maintains the running total, like a prefix sum array or a cumulative total in the shopping cart object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintain a History of Purchases: Use a dynamic array or a linked list to store the order history, allowing easy additions and retrievals.\n",
